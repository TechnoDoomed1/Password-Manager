# Password-Manager
A password manager of my own that I created out of curiosity to see if I'd be capable to do such a thing. Seemed easy enough, and was a pretty relaxing thing to devote my times between finals. It uses my own cryptosystem because... well, why not? I wanted to put it to use instead of just looking pretty on my hard drive. The file is in English, but the UI is in Spanish. I'll translate it soon enough, as well as adding an option to change the master password later. Right now, it's released "as it is".

Originally it was made for personal use only, but a few days ago a friend requested it so he could use it, so... I made some extra changes to be used for anyone who fancies it. Like not having my master password's hash hardcoded into it, and being able to specify any master password one desires.

### For anyone interested in using it
You'll need Python 3 installed to use this Password Manager. It will create two files called "datafile.tsv" and "hash.dat" which store your encrypted passwords, and your encrypted master password's hash respectively. 

**DON'T LOSE THOSE FILES, OR YOU'LL LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR STORED PASSWORDS**

Also, don't forget your master password, or you won't be able to enter the Manager ever again. Let me make it clear again by using bold uppercase letters: 

####DON'T LOSE FILES CREATED BY THIS MANAGER, OR LOSE/FORGET YOUR MASTER PASSWORD! IF YOU DO, YOU'LL LOSE EVERYTHING YOU STORED!!
